Reviews Per Minute is film reviews as long as the films themselves. Each review has a word count that corresponds to the length of the film in minutes (as recorded on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/)). The longer the film, the longer the review.

Reviews Per Minute is a project by [Simon Bowie](https://simonxix.com) who is a culture writer, film critic, open source systems developer, open licensing advocate, critical librarian, photographer, and podcaster.
