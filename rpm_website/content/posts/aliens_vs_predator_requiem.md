A prurient and nasty film with deeply conservative undercurrents. REQUIEM not only cannot comprehend the anti-capitalist message of the original ALIEN but transforms the (sub-)franchise into something horribly regressive in service of cutting the Xenomorph down into a monster from a generic slasher movie and symbolically punishing the people on the lowest rungs of neoliberal society. Though the film is often too dark to see the actual scenes, what we can see in this film are embryonic traces of the franchise blockbuster model which will soon come to dominate 21st Century Hollywood filmmaking.
