What’s it called? Cumbernauld! Bill Forsyth has an incredible ability to draw a whole character in only a few brush strokes. The world of the film feels so fully realised, aided by genuinely hilarious background visual gags like the boys’ toilets as some kind of speakeasy and the hapless high jumper. There’s a charming awkwardness about not only the lead performances but the whole atmosphere of the film that makes it feel authentically teenage despite the somewhat heightened world. Not up to the level of LOCAL HERO but not far off.
