It took me like five or ten minutes to dial into the tone of BOTTOMS because it’s a lot more heightened than I expected for a high-school comedy. But once I tapped into the specifically absurdist satirical tone, lying somewhere between MEAN GIRLS and THE NAKED GUN, I found one of the best comedies of the year. The story is a little formulaic but there’s more than enough wild subversion and basically every joke in the script (and improvised!) lands. Ayo Edebiri should be cast in everything ([apart from the MCU](https://www.cinemablend.com/superheroes/marvel-cinematic-universe/thunderbolts-ayo-edebiri-why-shes-excited-join-mcu)).
