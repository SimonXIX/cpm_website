Visually stunning and manages to step up the formal experimentation in cinematic animation that made INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE so outstanding. Miles (Shameik Moore) has a strong arc that does more than recapitulate the first film.

My problem is with the fundamental premise: that there is canonical suffering required for Spider-People. We’ll see how this develops in the next part but this film makes Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac) so profoundly fascist that it taints every Spider-Person who chooses to go along with him. I like [Abigail Nussbaum’s reading](https://wrongquestions.blogspot.com/2023/06/five-things-i-loved-in-spider-man.html) that this represents the resistance to Miles as symbolic of diversity but it fundamentally morally compromises all the Spider-People. The idea that multiversal canon events are necessary also undermines the contingent nature of every Spider-Man’s arc: that if he took responsibility and chose to do the right thing, tragedy could have been avoided.
