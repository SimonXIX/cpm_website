If you were scheduling an eco-”terrorism” double-bill of NIGHT MOVES with [HOW TO BLOW UP A PIPELINE](https://takeonecinema.net/2023/how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline/), you’d have to screen NIGHT MOVES first so that its languid pace wasn’t a comedown after the extreme tension of [PIPELINE](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/how_to_blow_up_a_pipeline/). Though covering similar thematic ground around the ethics of eco-terrorism, NIGHT MOVES is both more didactic and more equivocating than PIPELINE. The slow-boiling tension of the first half gives way to a morally uncertain second half with the irritating implication that violence against fossil fuel infrastructure begets and is equivalent to interpersonal violence as if violence against property and violence against people are the same thing. Slow, atmospheric, and thirty minutes too long.
