The older women in this would have better chemistry as a lesbian couple than as sisters. I presumed the script had made them sisters so as not to alienate the conservative audience for this specific subgenre of bad Christmas romcoms. But then I thought, is that really the audience for these films? Has it not totally shifted to extremely online, irony-poisoned Letterboxd users like me who treat the whole month of December as a long MST3K episode? Are there still people watching this subgenre sincerely?
