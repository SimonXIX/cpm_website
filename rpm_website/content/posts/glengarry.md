Like THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS feels like a play in that it’s carried by its terrific dialogue and performances. This is a man’s world (perhaps only one woman in the background in the Chinese restaurant) with all the toxicity and grime that that implies. These are Masters of the Universe in miniature: men who were raised to rule the world reduced to resetting their personalities wholesale to sell property deals that no-one needs and, since this is the only masculine satisfaction they can achieve, their whole world has been reduced to the game of lying and selling.
