A fairly languid biopic of Nora Barnacle (Susan Lynch) and her relationship with James Joyce (Ewan McGregor), a relationship that seemed as toxic as it was sexually charged. Lynch is pretty good as Nora, her hair growing ever larger and wilder the more neglected and abandoned she becomes. McGregor is never quite convincing as a tormented writer and his petty jealousies *feel* petty rather than understandable which makes the central relationship feel weightless. [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/film/nora/) draws its data from the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/41165-nora) so we can blame them for Lynch getting second-billing behind a man in the cast credits on a movie where she plays the titular character.
