Trapped in the intersection of mental health issues, trauma-induced anxiety, and contemporary Scottish racism, Grace (Déborah Lukumuena) seeks to insulate her and her daughter Ama (Le’Shantey Bonsu) against the world outside their high-rise flat. Ama seeks a world beyond her mother. A tough watch partly because Lukumuena’s striking performance was triggeringly accurate for me in her depiction of panic attacks. A beautiful film that shows an unbeautiful world: the lighting of Black skin was particularly impressive and effective in letting the actors express themselves through subtle gestures.
