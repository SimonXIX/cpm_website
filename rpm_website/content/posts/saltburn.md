Emerald Fennell follows up her debut with another black comedy dealing with a vector of privilege: this time, the British class system. However the satirising of the upper class never feels as precisely incisive as PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN’s examination of abusive men and “nice guys”. There’s a funny visual gag involving Harry Potter but the portrayal of the upper class family too often pivots into caricature. 

Though beautifully shot by Linus Sandgren, the film itself is wildly uneven, spending a lot of time building up to a rushed and inelegant denouement. After a specific plot beat, the film’s momentum falls into a lake. 

All that said, it’s a fun film and it’s a pleasure to see Barry Keoghan, Rosamund Pike, and Richard E. Grant having a great time with their roles.
