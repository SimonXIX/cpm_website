The last two seconds of SAINT MAUD prove Rose Glass is a visceral filmmaker and that’s on full aural and visual display in LOVE LIES BLEEDING: we hear the sounds of muscles stretching and throats constricting; we see jawbones breaking and blood spatter squelching. This visceral cinematic expression is in service of a modern-day THELMA AND LOUISE where queerness isn’t the backbone of the narrative but just one element of this love and revenge story. In different ways, Lou (Kristen Stewart) and Jackie (Katy O’Brian) both learn to embrace the metaphorical monsters that society has turned them into and use that self-knowledge for liberation.
