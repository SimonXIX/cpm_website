I’ve been to that carousel in Brooklyn: walked around the riverfront and had my photo taken in front of the Manhattan backdrop by the person I love. But PAST LIVES felt like a memory long before that scene. It’s so deeply and delicately enmeshed in a sense of time(s) and place(s) that it feels specific, it feels real, it feels like a memory in a way that [tears a feeling open inside you](https://allunits.libsyn.com/calling-all-units-abuse-of-power-comes-as-no-surprise-tarantinocore-green-room). Despite the script’s jabs at the voyeuristic nature of cinema and Arthur’s (John Magaro) self-reflexive monologue about the clichéd story structure, PAST LIVES feels wholly original, wholly new, and wholly real.
