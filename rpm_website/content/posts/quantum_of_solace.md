A victim of sloppy pre-production and the AMPTP’s failure to negotiate, QUANTUM OF SOLACE was clearly not ready to be made. Quite apart from the undercooked script, Eon Productions should have waited to settle with Kevin McClory’s estate so their shadowy criminal organisation could have been Spectre instead of the damp squib that is Quantum (though interesting in retrospect to use ‘Q’ as a symbol for their globalist conspiratorial organisation). The too-many action sequences are directed without a sense of spatial cohesion and the attempted themes around climate change, green(e)washing, and Western imperialist involvement in South American coups are too blunt to be incisive.
