Some great set pieces especially the underwater heist and the opera scene but overall a step backwards in terms of direction, script, and cinematography. Sean Harris and his weak chin make for a good villain and the ‘anti-IMF’ concept is strong: this should have been the foundation for a two-parter not [DEAD RECKONING’s](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/mission_impossible_dead_reckoning/) nebulous rogue AI.

The tone is thankfully carried over from [GHOST PROTOCOL](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/mission_impossible_ghost_protocol/) but unfortunately ROGUE NATION marks the point at which the franchise decides to be to ‘friendship’ what the Fast & Furious franchise is to ‘family’. There’s some ironic commentary on the franchise itself and the script deliberately subverts many of the Mission: Impossible tropes that have developed but, given where the franchise goes in the next few films, it feels less like subversion and more like stagnation.
