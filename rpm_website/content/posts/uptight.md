In the depth of his drunken despair, Tank (Julian Mayfield) stands in front of a carnival mirror and gives a funhouse description of the Black revolution to some credulous rich white people. It’s a great representation of Tank’s character: a successful union man who has unfortunately discovered he loved industry rather than the militancy required for revolution. UPTIGHT is deeply enmeshed in the radical politics of Black Power and the debate about the need for revolutionary violence but finds the personal amidst the political by centering the crisis of conscience of a man who would snitch on his brothers. Gorgeously lit and terrifically edited.
