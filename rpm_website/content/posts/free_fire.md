Amy Jump and Ben Wheatley pull out a three minute shootout scene from a standard action film and expand it to a full ninety minutes making every bullet impact important, every injury significant, and every movement a struggle. This expansion stretches the characters fairly thin but strong performances especially from Cillian Murphy, Michael Smiley, and Sharlto Copley buoy them up. Not nearly as stylish and Tarantino-esque as it thinks it is but it makes up for that by embodying precisely what Tarantino doesn’t: stripped-down and economic filmmaking. Up the ‘RA.
