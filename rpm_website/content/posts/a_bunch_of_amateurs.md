No horror film builds dread in quite the same way as idly noticing from a date in a brief shot that this film starts in 2019. For most of the documentary, Covid-19 looms on the horizon, surely portending doom for this small movie-making club and its eccentric, mostly elderly, members. This bittersweet sense of steadfastly continuing to do what you love infuses the documentary and portrays the intense meaningfulness of this small club to its members (similar to Detectorists). A charming portrait of the importance of artistic expression outside of the usual cultural centres.
