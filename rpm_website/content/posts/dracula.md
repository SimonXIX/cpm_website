A horny fugue state of a film that adopts the novel’s epistolary format in a way that doesn’t really work on film. Despite that, it’s undeniable how bold the vision is. The sets may look a little ropey but the on-set filming allows Francis Ford Coppola so much control over the composition of shots that he produces some exquisite and singular images. Everything from the camera movements to the costumes to the colours and lighting are so controlled that you can’t help but admire the directorial boldness of more or less every decision. It makes for a camp extravaganza that goes big and encourages every actor in the ensemble to go as big as possible. Plus every film gets a whole extra star when it casts Tom Waits.
