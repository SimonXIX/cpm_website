A cautionary tale about moving to a community that you know nothing about, buying someone’s foreclosed home, stealing or selling all the stuff that they left, using their personal effects and family photos to start making a documentary film about them without their consent, and recording their vulnerable father in a convalescent home without his permission. Absurdly bad pacing that becomes clearest in the final act when you see how much exposition they suddenly need to do around elements that should have been introduced in the first act. For example, the Devil’s Throat, a pit in the woods (that apparently has its own sign?) that comes out of nowhere to be highly significant. Nice to see Juliette Lewis.
