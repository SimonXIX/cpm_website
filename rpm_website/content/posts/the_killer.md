David Fincher doing what he does best: exposing the facile hollowness and obsessive self-delusion of a particular kind of man. In this case, The Killer (Michael Fassbender) is the kind of 4chan-pilled Sigma who recites the 48 Laws of Power to himself, refers to other people as “normies” or NPCs, and relies on the silent labour and concealed structures of the gig economy to minimise his contact with other people. In his internal monologue, he’s a cool and efficient assassin with an unearned self-belief that is unshakeable no matter how many times he spectacularly fucks up or falls asleep on the job. Fincher hasn’t been as brutally ironic about a protagonist he clearly hates since THE SOCIAL NETWORK.
