An origin story in the mould of JOKER in that the events of the narrative do not make the character into the character we see in other films. Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) starts the film as a chocolate-making eccentric and, sure, he acquires a chocolate factory by the end but that happens in thirty seconds after the film’s main narrative has been concluded. Chalamet is woefully miscast and this is most apparent whenever he attempts a line delivery like Gene Wilder. For a fun children’s film, a lot of scenes were horribly underlit (not helped by the digital projection at the multiplex where I saw it) which muted the colours. Go listen to [*Primus & the Chocolate Factory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primus_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory_with_the_Fungi_Ensemble) instead.
