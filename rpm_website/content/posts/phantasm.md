PHANTASM resonates with a specific Lynchian frequency while also operating with a Buñuelian sense of dream (nightmare) logic. It almost seems to anticipate elements of Lynch’s DUNE, BLUE VELVET, and Twin Peaks and shares Lynch’s preoccupation with the weirdness of the American suburbs. Specifically PHANTASM explores the uncanniness of suburban funeral parlours and cemeteries: monumental edifices built for mourning and death that take up prominent space in our towns but which by unspoken understanding we as a society have all agreed to turn away from as much as possible.
