Like the main characters, this film has a charm and a sincerity that are both beguiling even while it settles into a diffuseness that feels a little frustrating. There’s a good mix of Coen Brothers’ postmodern sensibility with Godard’s rebellious young man archetype but this also takes on some of the worst qualities of both in its sense of youthful aimlessness. It didn’t really work for me but it’s interesting to see the embryonic elements of Wes Anderson’s aesthetic steadily emerge particularly in the sequences reshot from the short film version.
