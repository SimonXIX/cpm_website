“It seemed there was no longer anything a Conservative government could do to cause it to be voted out of office. [...] The press, the voting system, the impropriety of Tory party funding, none of these could explain away the fact that the middle class in England had continued to vote Conservative because in their miserable hearts they still believed that it was in their interests to do so.”

An astonishingly relevant psychogeographic portrait of the UK’s post-imperial decline after years of successive disastrous Tory governments.
