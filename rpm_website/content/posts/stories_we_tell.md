More so than biological relationships or shared DNA, families are tapestries of histories and stories repeated again and again until they become legends. But each family member has a different perspective, a different understanding of the world and hence the family itself. Every family needs a black sheep, doesn’t it? 

There’s something very touching in the banality of STORIES WE TELL. This isn’t as fantastic a story as THREE IDENTICAL STRANGERS or [MY OLD SCHOOL](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/my_old_school/) but it’s all the more powerful for that simplicity and hence its universality. Every family has stories and perhaps one grand story that could be filmed and remixed and fictionalised and repeated like this.
