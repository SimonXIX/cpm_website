“And there’s this feeling, once you leave where you grew up, that you don’t totally belong there again.” When I was a kid in the ‘90s, we'd go on family holidays to resorts in places like Majorca and Malta. But as I got older, I didn't like heat and I didn't like suncream and all the family time felt claustrophobic. It's on these holidays that you start to realise your own preferences and start the painful process of becoming your own person. But also Dad would hold my hand and I’d walk along a small wall and we'd sing Walking On Sunshine.
