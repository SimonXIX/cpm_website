Beautifully shot, joyously inventive and subversive, emotionally real. Most importantly, RYE LANE captures the messy energy of South London, a place I called home for the better part of a decade. It’s not just the places in Peckham and Brixton that I walked past a hundred times, it’s the people that the film depicts who all have that ineffable South London quality that makes the place a real community within a metropolis. Capturing that spirit on film is nothing short of incredible.
