A Bond film infused with the spirit of New Labour from the opening action scene focused on the triumphalist national symbolism of the Millennium Dome and the economic regeneration of the Isle of Dogs to the scenes where MI6 sets up temporary headquarters in Scotland acting as an allegory for devolution. Compare and contrast this film’s depiction of power moving from London to Scotland to the country’s appearance in 2012’s SKYFALL where it’s positioned as a dead and decaying ancestral home, an denuded place where no-one would ever look for Bond and M. Unfortunately, like New Labour, the film ultimately gets tied up in incoherent political and corporate plans involving oil and Russian oligarchs before getting bogged down by confused speeches and corny one-liners that simply aren’t meaningful.
