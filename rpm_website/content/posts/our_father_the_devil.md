Ellie Foumbi’s debut feature makes terrific use of light and shadow for its story of trauma, revenge, and forgiveness. Marie (Babetida Sadjo) is haunted by her past trauma and sees it in the face of the new priest, Father Patrick (Souleymane Sy Savane). Father Patrick’s face is hidden for his first few scenes and even after it’s revealed, his face is often shrouded in shadow or emerging out of darkness cultivating an air of menace even as he protests his innocence of the crimes against Marie. As things spiral out of control, it’s Marie’s face that increasingly gets shrouded in darkness as we question whose account is true.
