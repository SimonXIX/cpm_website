A post-apocalyptic period piece filmed in the context of the nuclear annihilation of two cities and 220,000 people, RASHOMON strips down humanity until it finds cynicism, deceit, selfishness, and despair. With no truth, there can be no agreement and no reconciliation or forgiveness even after the body’s death. It’s a bleak, empty, and egotistic world where everyone is out only for themselves. Until, that is, a baby cries and hope is found in the simple act of kindness to the generation who can rebuild this shattered world.
