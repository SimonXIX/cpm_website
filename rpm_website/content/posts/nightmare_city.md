From the title and [the poster](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nightjarprod/content/uploads/sites/4/2022/08/30160951/nightmare-city-poster.jpg), you’d be forgiven for thinking NIGHTMARE CITY takes place in apocalyptic urban streets like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. Surprisingly little of the film takes place in una città. Instead we alternate between scenes of women’s blouses being torn open and their breasts mutilated by zombie-vampires to scenes of characters wandering through fields or an abandoned theme park delivering the film’s tacked-on accelerationist message about the cyclical nature of civilisation and humanity bringing this on themselves with capitalist conveniences. Don’t climb a rollercoaster to escape from zombie-vampires.
