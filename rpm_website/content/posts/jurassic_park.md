A film with incredible depth of detail. On the big screen for the 30th anniversary, I caught so many small background details in almost every frame that catch the eye but aren’t visually overwhelming and make the world feel lived in. There are subtle character moments peppered throughout the screenplay that quietly expand the characters (despite abundant places for a helipad across the island, Hammond has deliberately placed it in a valley with wind shears so that it’s next to an amazing waterfall underscoring his prioritisation of spectacle over safety). Seeing it in the cinema, I was struck by the sound: the subtle ‘80s-style synth in the opening’s score and the incredible sound design of all the various dinosaurs’ different calls, especially the T. rex and velociraptors.
