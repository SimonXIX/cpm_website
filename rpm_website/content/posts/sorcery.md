SORCERY (BRUJERÍA) tells the fascinating story of the [La Recta Provincia witch trial in 19th century Chile](https://doi.org/10.4000/anthrovision.3946) in a dull and dreary way. There’s resonant anti-colonial themes and an amazing performance from newcomer Valentina Véliz Caileo but the whole film around it feels so lifeless and flat, a slow burn that doesn’t lead to any explosion. SORCERY is interesting as an attempt to do what critics said [KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/killers_of_the_flower_moon/) should do and show the murder of Indigenous people by white settlers from the perspective of the victims rather than the murderers but the overall result is disappointingly forgettable.
