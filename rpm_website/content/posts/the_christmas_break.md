A couple who communicate almost exclusively in bombshell decisions go away to Ã‰ire for Christmas and make decisions at each other. This bad Christmas movie gets points for actually being filmed in the Republic rather than a soundstage in Canada and for Justin Long who brings a measure of charm to a character who would be quite irritating on paper. I also enjoyed the young lad who gets self-help-pilled towards the end. Unfortunately one subplot hinges on a Christmas Eve Gaelic football match which goes on for like five to ten minutes onscreen and is very tedious to watch.
