Continuing a series of [films about deeply frustrating German men](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/passages/). Leon (Thomas Schubert) is always watching people from a distance and talking to them through windows accentuating the gulf he perceives between himself and other people. He’s one of life’s naysayers—saying no to others, to himself, to joy, to creative expression—and can be a real asshole but he’s relatable nonetheless. Christian Petzold directs with his characteristic light touch deftly commenting on narcissism, publishing, and climate crisis in ways that feel effortlessly natural. Even though the whole is a little uneven in tone, the film comes together beautifully and tragically in its final moments.
