Fortunately for [our podcast](https://takeonecinema.net/thexenopod/), it’s more interesting to discuss this film than it is to watch it. The film itself is bland and generic with paper-thin characters, a frankly unappealing visual aesthetic, and dialogue that could have been spat out by a machine-learning model. But it represents a fascinating point for the Alien franchise’s turn from a multimedia to a transmedia franchise and occupies a contested position as both mothership text and paratext. There’s also an intriguing path not taken with the Black female main character and the shooting script’s promise that she will return in the unmade Alien/Predator: Annihilation.
