Xxxxx'x x xxxxxxxxxx xxxx xx xx made that A VERY ENGLISH CHRISTMAS is a psychological reflection of the main character’s narcissism in how it moves hollow characters around on the chessboard of the narrative with no regard for their feelings or interiority. Kate’s (Kimberley Nixon) American mother is brought over to England from California at one day’s notice for the wedding of her ex-husband’s daughter and the mother is blankly accepting of this: she doesn’t even get a scene with her ex-husband to say ‘hello’ let alone acknowledge complex feelings.
