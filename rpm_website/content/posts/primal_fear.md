PRIMAL FEAR contains some of the understated hallmarks of ‘90s thrillers: an obsession with property development; corruption that goes up to the highest levels of local government; questionable treatment of mental health issues; women that exist only in the orbit of men. The cast appears absolutely stacked from a current perspective but this is primarily because of how successful several of them became years after filming this like Frances McDormand (FARGO came out one month before this), Andre Braugher, and Terry O’Quinn. Richard Gere leads doing his same old Richard Gere-thing but the real draw is a stellar performance from Edward Norton in his first film role who is so good here that it seems like a shame he couldn’t play Brad Pitt’s role in FIGHT CLUB alongside himself.
