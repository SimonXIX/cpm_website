Loath though I am to suggest that this film should have more THE ROOM-level dialogue or more scenes of hunky shirtless men or more confusingly-staged melodrama or more scenes of the mother (Nicky Whelan) and son (Parker Mack) who look the same age but PRETTY LITTLE STALKERS really needed more establishing scenes for most of its central characters. We’re told that Mark is popular but he really doesn’t come across like that. A romance develops between Mallory (Ashley Rickards) and Mark mostly off-screen.
