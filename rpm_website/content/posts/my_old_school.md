When I was at school, a teacher wrote the word ‘prat’ on a pupil’s forehead in permanent marker. I wasn’t in the class where this happened but it became legend throughout the school, passed on through gossip in the corridors and the schoolyard. Such mythic status was leant to this story that to this day I can remember the name of the teacher and the name of the pupil. MY OLD SCHOOL works by tapping into the gossipy but friendly tone of old classmates reminiscing at a school reunion about those high school events that seemed so significant but no-one remembers with 100% clarity.
