In Paul T. Goldman, director Jason Woliner unravels the life and works of Paul Finkelman, a delusional but affable man whose experiences of life revolve outwards into bizarre and fantastical pastiches of crime dramas and blockbuster action films. Each plot twist in Finkelman’s amateurish novellas and screenplays makes less sense than the last, building and building to crescendos of joyously unintended absurdity. DO YOU KNOW ME? is like if someone filmed one of Paul T. Goldman’s books as a 100% straight adaptation.
