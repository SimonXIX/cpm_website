Despite being a B-movie horror with a terrible script mostly set in a single back garden, I was struck by how much the whole film is elevated by having a well-trained canine actor playing Thor (Primo). In a cinema landscape filled with obviously-CGI animals like in the dreadful trailer for ARGYLLE, itâ€™s notable how much emotional and narrative weight an animal actor can bring to a film. It makes even a werewolf flirting with his own sister seem more real.
