A mix of THE WICKER MAN and GROUNDHOG DAY that is an interesting blend of genres but adds up to less than the sum of its parts. A community of women refugees living on a small island are treated as non-citizens by the wider world; they are ghosts in the land of the living. Their fragile existence is disrupted when male violence encroaches on their island. STONE TURTLE has a beautifully animated and heartbreaking [eye-of-the-duck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-OeCYaZgT4) scene that evokes THE RED TURTLE and holds the key to unlocking the whole film.
