A love story told backwards taking us from the devastating impact of a couple’s long-running emotional affair to the tragedy that cemented their lives together in the first place. THE BURNING SEASON joins a long lineage of media that [I’ve discussed extensively elsewhere](https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:56781) where trauma is represented through the depiction of non-linear time, through time warping around a traumatic event and pulling the characters back towards it like a black hole. A slight romantic drama made effective by some convincingly couple-y dialogue and performances that ground the central relationship.
