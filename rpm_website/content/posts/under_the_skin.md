An English woman struggles to find the M8 and gradually learns to see Scottish people as human beings. 

The best representations of the alien and unknown use abstract visual poetry to represent the alien as not only unknown and unknowable but literally inconceivable to us within the bounds that we think in. UNDER THE SKIN excels at this from the opening moments immersing us in eerie conceptual imagery and Mica Levi’s otherworldly but menacing score. I’d never noticed before but there’s slightly disjointed editing in her early interactions with the random Glaswegian men she picks up and it really contributes to the unmoored feeling of that first half.
