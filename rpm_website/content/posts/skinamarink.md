A haunted house story with the vibe of creepypasta, specifically the Backrooms. This has a lot of the DNA of [THIS HOUSE HAS PEOPLE IN IT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-pj8OtyO2I), SLEEP HAS HER HOUSE, and House of Leaves. The constant low-angles and extreme close-ups of the digital cameras act like an eerie inversion of CCTV which leaves you tantalisingly unable to perceive the whole space. The quasi-experimental form messes with the pacing somewhat but itâ€™s rare for me to find a horror film that genuinely scares me and there are slow pans in this that are more terrifying than any rapidly edited jump scares.
