Within a three-month period in 1995, THE NET and then HACKERS came out: the Barbenheimer of 1990s computer-themed thrillers. THE NET has none of the joie de vivre of HACKERS and no amount of extreme close-ups on character’s mouths or computer GUIs can save it. Multiple characters in this film order a Gibson, a gin martini with a pickled onion instead of an olive, and yet their shared love for this unusual cocktail is not a plot point, presumably it’s just a cocktail that the screenwriters like. The best bit was when Senator Martin (Diane Baker) from THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS showed up and I could do Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill impressions.
