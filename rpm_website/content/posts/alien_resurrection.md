At the end of the film, the Newborn is violently sucked through a tiny hole into Earth’s upper atmosphere. This film feels like trying to suck the Alien franchise through a much-diminished perspective to become a generic and misogynistic blockbuster. Most of the blame must lie with Whedon’s script which firmly shifts the sexual locus of the franchise from ALIEN’s ‘monstrous feminine’ to the most mundane implementation of male gaze from the perspective of a teenage boy. Ripley’s new ‘sexy but threatening’ persona completely disregards what worked about the character in the previous films. A script that doesn’t work with a director who does not fit the Alien franchise.
