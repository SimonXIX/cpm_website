“You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing. Music's changing, even drugs are changing.”

A film that’s not about heroin. It’s about being young and being addicted to being young and being just old enough to not actually be young anymore. About outgrowing your old friends and making mistakes and being worried that now you’re not young you’re going to be the same sad and broken person for the rest of your life. About being stuck in endlessly repeating patterns and trying desperately to break free while still being who you are.
