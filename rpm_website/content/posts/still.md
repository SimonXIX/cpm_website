A sensitive and joyously optimistic documentary about living with a condition in an industry that punishes things it sees as disabilities. Michael J. Fox comes across as charming, witty, and self-reflective in a way rarely seen in Hollywood actors of his generation. It is incredibly endearing how much he clearly adores his wife, Tracy. I would have liked there to have been a little more biographical detail of his life and his career after the point he revealed his Parkinsonâ€™s diagnosis to the world so as to lessen the impression of a career cut short.
