A great performance from Jane Fonda as a sex worker whose reward for navigating a paranoid world of shadowy figures and sexual assault is to end up with John Klute (Donald Sutherland), the most boring man alive. Alan J. Pakula excels at capturing the dark grime of 1970s Manhattan and the paranoid state of America at the time. Fonda carries the film with a humanising portrayal of a woman traumatised by men’s violence and unashamed of her profession. It’s just such a shame that Sutherland’s character is the basis for the title and yet his character is so bland: he’s also the same age as me currently in this but looks ten years older.
