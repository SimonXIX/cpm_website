Steven Beard (Eli Gabay) is the exemplar American man: extraordinarily wealthy despite having no apparent job and consisting on a diet exclusively of beef. His new wife, Celeste (Julie Benz) plots to have him injured just enough so that he has time to change his will before dying. Despite Celesteâ€™s plot to seduce a rich man and have her lesbian lover shoot him, the film is oddly sexless and a last-minute evocation of the Bible leaves the viewer wondering if this was a Christian movie all along.
