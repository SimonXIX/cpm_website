A cosmic mix of the dramas of the ‘10s combined with the exploitation films of the ‘70s. There is constant surprise in how layered and postmodern the film is willing to get but it always keeps a sense of playfulness and joy in its use of ‘70s exploitation tropes and metafictional devices right up until the end. Despite its postmodern flourishes, LEONOR WILL NEVER DIE remains grounded through the central focus on its characters and the wonderful sense of coming to know someone through their work and through their love of movies. Almost moves to the beat of jazz.
