The insensitively-titled WHITE SETTLERS is a low-budget representation of how culturally afraid the English are of the Scottish. Released during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, [director Simeon Halligan spoke in an interview](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/08/scottish-referendum-horror-movie-white-settlers) about "a sense that there is an intolerance or a lack of understanding from both sides" and that bland centrism comes across in the filmâ€™s confusion about what point it wants to make, if any, about Anglo-Scottish relations. The Scots are depicted as barbaric pig-men, the English as pretentious cowardly dullards.
