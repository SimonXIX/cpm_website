A pandemic sci-fi thriller that might be too much for those exhausted by the last few years but that offers an eerie atmosphere and some interesting twists and turns. Sometimes it’s hard to tell if I get frustrated by clumsy tropes because I’ve watched too many films or if it’s an unfortunate element of the script. Either way it’s a shame that this starts so promisingly and descends into a third act of genre tropes, most egregiously the computer that auto-plays the most narratively pertinent recordings when it turns on.
