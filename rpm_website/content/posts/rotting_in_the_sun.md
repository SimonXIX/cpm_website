Maybe the best way to explore the modern human condition is through black comedy. ROTTING IN THE SUN is an inventive and surprising satire on what it’s like to live now, in existences mediated by the internet. Apart from Vero (Catalina Saavedra), all the characters’ have their experience of the world mediated through their phones: from the opening shots of Sebastián (Sebastián Silva) googling how to commit suicide to the fatal moment of inattention while scrolling Instagram to the final scene of a manslaughter confession being garbled by a translation app. The depressed young creatives are in prisons of social media, of ego, and of the Instagram brands they’ve built around themselves.
