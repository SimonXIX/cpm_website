A documentary about the theme of failure that abdicates its responsibility to discuss the actual human costs of failure. Stephen Skrynka is a visual artist obsessed with the Wall of Death, a fairground stunt attraction inside which a motorcyclist drives around the walls of a wooden cylinder. Though the documentary focuses on superficial surface level failures—Stephen falling off motorcycles and injuring himself—it fails to adequately explore the emotional and financial costs of the larger failures to the people he’s enlisted to help him achieve his dreams.
