A lot of flashbacks, early-’00s montages, and repetition to hide the fact that there’s really not much to this movie. It’s desperately aspiring to be SEVEN but lacking the care and attention to character that Fincher brings to that film. Instead it focuses on SEVEN’s final scene attempting to craft enough twists, inversions, and narrative convolutions to evoke the idea of a satisfying narrative twist. Cary Elwes is a good actor and so it’s a little strange how poor he is in this especially in the third act. Is the involvement of the puppet explained in a subsequent one of these or no?
