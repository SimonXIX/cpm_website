CORNER OFFICE taps into a specific niche of absurdism directed at the banalities of everyday existence that I associate with Scandinavian directors like Roy Andersson and Thomas Vinterberg. Beneath the film’s chilly Brutalist surface, there’s a Kafkaesque examination of the anomie and mental compartmentalisation required by the 21st Century corporate workplace that really clicked for me. Jon Hamm excels himself with a performance that taps into the sheer unpleasantness demanded of a good corporate worker and carries the film along with a dour, monotonous, and fascinatingly grotesque narration. Reminded me of Richard Ayoade’s THE DOUBLE by way of The Stanley Parable.
