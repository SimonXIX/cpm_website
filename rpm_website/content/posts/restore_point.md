Like [THE CREATOR](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/the_creator/), RESTORE POINT (BOD OBNOVY) showcases what CGI visual effects can be produced on a small budget in a way that puts much more expensive Hollywood blockbusters to shame. The BLADE RUNNER 2049-type skyline and the MINORITY REPORT slick technology all look great and fit into the world without obvious CGI aesthetics or horrendously offputting green-screen. Unfortunately the story also liberally borrows plot beats from other sci-fi films ultimately making the whole thing feel very familiar and very predictable. If you’ve seen I, ROBOT or Bodies, then you’ve seen this and it won’t surprise you to learn that the corporation behind the future technology might not be entirely trustworthy.
