Like the film’s wyrd combination of paganism and Christianity, it’s the combination of elements that elevates this early entry into what we’d now call the folk horror subgenre. Aside from the striking French location, the British production mixes in other elements of French filmmaking from the time with editing and dynamic cinematography evocative of the Surrealists and a beguilingly erotic performance from Sharon Tate. The Francophone elements combine with a British horror of the rural and distrust of Roman Catholicism to create a fascinating mood that Robin Hardy would build upon to make THE WICKER MAN.
