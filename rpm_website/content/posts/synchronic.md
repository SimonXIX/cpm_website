This needed to be a few degrees closer to LIMITLESS on the magic-drug-subgenre spectrum. The core premise is interesting and I liked the film’s allusions to the racial implications of time travel but a film about time travel drugs really doesn’t need to be so dour and so bogged down in character work that really doesn’t add anything narratively or thematically. The first hour is very focused on character crises unrelated to the core premise and it all gets a little ‘[when are they going to get to the fireworks factory?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFBmIwlrPdY)’. Also why didn’t Synchronic ever send him forward in time?
