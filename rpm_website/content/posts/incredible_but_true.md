A relatively grounded—for Quentin Dupieux—meditation on ageing and rejuvenation via two interconnected stories. ‘Grounded’ here involves a time-defying tunnel in a basement and an electronic iPenis but still more verité than Dupieux’s RUBBER or DEERSKIN. This isn’t nearly as effective as his more Surrealist work and could have worked better as a short film: as it starts to outstay its welcome, it wisely descends into montage as events spiral to their all-too inevitable conclusions.
