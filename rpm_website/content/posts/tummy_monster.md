Rub your tummy or I’ll think you’re an asshole. UNCUT GEMS in Glasgow: a tense, strange, and frequently hilarious psychological drama that gradually turns a ridiculous situation into the cosmic metaphysical horror of painful and anxious rebirth. Lorn Macdonald and Orlando Norman deliver terrific performances respectively as a hot mess of a tattoo artist and an anonymous popstar turned trickster god. It’s a wholly unexpected delight and a spectacularly confident debut feature from director Ciaran Lyons. Rub your tummy or I’ll think you’re an asshole.
