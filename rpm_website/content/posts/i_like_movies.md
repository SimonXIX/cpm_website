Enjoyable as a sweet throw-back to quirky indie comedies of the ‘00s: a little NAPOLEON DYNAMITE and a dash of Kevin Smith. Honestly it would work better if I hadn’t seen it at the same festival as [THERAPY DOGS](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/therapy_dogs/) because the two bear immediate comparison and I LIKE MOVIES comes out worse: both involve aspiring filmmakers in a Canadian high school who are putting together a year-end video and who have an emotionally conflict with their one friend and filmmaking partner. I LIKE MOVIES is the parallel universe THERAPY DOGS where it was made as a traditional filmic interpretation.
