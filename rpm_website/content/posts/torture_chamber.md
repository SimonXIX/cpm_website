A West German B-movie horror, the best part of which is the interesting production design from the paintings influenced by Hieronymous Bosch to the locations evocative of Dark Souls. ‘The Deserted Forest’ where the trees have human limbs extending from them could be straight out of a FromSoftware game. The original German title, ‘The Snake Pit and the Pendulum’, is much better but puts a lot of pressure on the third act’s setpieces which take up respectively two minutes and six minutes of movie time.
