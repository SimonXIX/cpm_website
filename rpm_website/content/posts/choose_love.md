An interactive romantic comedy with a frustrating lack of both comedy and interactivity. There simply aren’t enough choices: why does Cami (Laura Marano) have to end up with any of these irritatingly bland men; why can’t she end up with all of them; why couldn’t she make some friends who aren’t her sister; why couldn’t she have beaten up the kid who picked on her niece? Bizarrely structured, cheap looking, and less fun than a standard Hallmark.
