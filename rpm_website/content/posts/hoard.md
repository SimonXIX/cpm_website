For a film about hoarding and collecting excess, it’s almost appropriate how much cruft there is in HOARD that could have been edited out and pared down. This could have been a much tighter film about the looming spectre of family mental illness and how love and sexual awakening brings these chaotic demons to the surface. The central idea of the “catalogue of love” is heartbreaking in its tenderness and its grotesque implications and the film needed to be streamlined for that emotional throughline. Both Saura Lightfoot Leon and Lily-Beau Leach are terrific as Maria, bringing the strange poetry of her illness to life in a way that’s as beautiful as it is disturbing. HOARD just needed less of the excess around that central emotional structure.
