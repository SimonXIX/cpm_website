Who doesnâ€™t love a movie built around a consistent rule scheme?: GREMLINS, THE PURGE, the Final Destinations. FINAL DESTINATION 5 made me wonder about a hypothetical Final Destination that exploits the internal logic of strictly ordered deaths such that, as long as the person in front of you in the death queue is kept alive, you could do whatever kind of dangerous stuff you wanted. Combine this idea with SAW and you could put that person in a safe room or a medically-induced coma and could in that way become functionally immortal.
