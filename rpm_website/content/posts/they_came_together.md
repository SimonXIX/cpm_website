This film deserves the acclaim that ANCHORMAN has for some reason: undeniably up there with THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE! as a perfectly observed absurdist parody of its genre. The hit rate of the gags is incredibly high but I’m especially a sucker for any joke that makes the subtext into text like Joel’s (Paul Rudd) friends who each explicitly represent a distinct point of view on his romantic relationships or how his coffee shop idea is a metaphor for his commitment issues.
