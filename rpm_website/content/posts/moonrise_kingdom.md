In an essay for the Criterion Collection Blu-ray, Isabel Folger writes that “Moonrise Kingdom shows that with the right people in your life, you won’t feel misunderstood.” There are some emotional moments that are so powerful that they justify entire films about them. MOONRISE KINGDOM is about that moment that you are seen—truly seen—for the first time. When Sam (Jared Gilman) sees Suzy (Kara Hayward), it doesn’t matter that they’ve never fit in before, that they’ve been labelled “emotionally disturbed” or “very troubled”. They find that one other person and suddenly fit just right.
