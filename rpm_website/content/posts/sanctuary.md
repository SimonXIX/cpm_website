SANCTUARY’s thoughtful depiction of fetish uses the sense of mystery behind sub-dom to bring the audience into the characters’ tangled power dynamics. You’re made part of the role-play because you, like the characters, don’t know what is real and what is erotic play. This wouldn’t work if the film didn’t also make you want Margaret Qualley to step on you. Her expressive face conveys what is otherwise left unsaid while also hiding secrets behind the role-play. The power of her role is in making you fall in love with her while basically learning nothing about her.
