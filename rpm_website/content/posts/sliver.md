SLIVER wants to be about voyeurism, surveillance, and power. But gesturing towards themes while not saying anything substantive about them is not enough for thematic resonance. There’s a kernel of an idea in the sequence where Carly (Sharon Stone) watches from the surveillance room as a teenager reveals her father’s abuse of her and then Carly sees the two in the elevator. Knowing the secrets of your neighbours but being unable to take action because of how you know about them is interesting. But the film isn’t interested in that and gets tangled in narrative convolutions while being about as deep as THE DARK KNIGHT on actual surveillance.
