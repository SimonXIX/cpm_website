A cosmic event strikes the lake where two brothers are swimming, mutilating one and dooming his chances of taking part in Europe’s first space colonisation mission. TROPIC is an intriguing blend of genres that talks about humanity and what it means to accept or abandon what cannot be changed. The film has a slow weirdness that evokes Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s MEMORIA and alludes to John Carpenter’s sci-fi horror of the ‘80s. TROPIC presents an interesting metaphor for what space colonisation would mean for the planet but could benefit from tighter editing to resolve some structural issues and a little more time spent on ancillary plotlines to build them up.
