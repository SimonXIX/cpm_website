Every frame of this film is burned into my brain after watching it once every two years or so since I was old enough but it remains delightful every time, joyous every time, and I well up every time during the scene of the Christmas yet-to-come where Tiny Tim (Jerry Nelson) has died. Itâ€™s wild that this iteration of Kermit (Steve Whitmire), one not performed by Jim Henson, might be the most frequently-seen Kermit. Disney is leaving money on the table by not doing other literary adaptations with Muppets.
