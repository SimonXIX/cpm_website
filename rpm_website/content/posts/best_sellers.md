A British man saying the word ‘bullshite’ is a load-bearing element of the narrative in BEST SELLERS which is unfortunate since that’s not a word that any British person has ever said. Michael Caine presumably could have told the production team this if only he hadn’t obviously  looked at the script for the first time seconds before the camera started rolling. A dull and formulaic comedy-drama with limp performances (apart from an effervescent cameo from Cary Elwes) and no real understanding of how mainstream publishing works. The second-best book tour movie I’ve seen, far below THE END OF THE TOUR.
