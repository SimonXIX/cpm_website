It’s a shame that this is so clearly made as a (apologies) copycat of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS since it actually has some interesting things to say about the influence of true crime on its audience and about [serial killer fandom](https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448221138768) and it’s a shame a lot of that is watered down by the film’s adherence to the structure and tone of its predecessor. We’ve been relaxing on weekends by watching mid-budget ‘90s thrillers and it’s noticeable how much more consideration even the most disposable of them give to shot composition, scene lighting, and camera movements than a lot of ultra-high-budget franchise blockbusters today. Unsurprising to learn that the Director of Photography was the great László Kovács.
