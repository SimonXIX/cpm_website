Tomas (Franz Rogowski) is an intense and chaotic star, pulling people into his orbit and taking position at the centre of their lives. This is most clear in the shots where his body literally eclipses one of his romantic partners in the frame (apart from one significant sex scene). He’s a deeply frustrating and overwhelmingly narcissistic man and it’s testament to Rogowski’s charm that it takes so long for this to become apparent and that, even when it does, Tomas remains human to the audience: contradictory, both fluid and rigid at once.
