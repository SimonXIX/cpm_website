An England riven by political division turns to superstitious persecution of people for the sadistic thrill of victimising an out-group. A charismatic leader makes money off his sadistic prejudice while commanding those less educated than him to bully, torture, and kill women. All the more horrific for taking place in broad daylight under the cloudy sky of a perpetually autumnal England with winter fast approaching. The least successful of the Unholy Trinity of British folk horror, for my money, despite its horror feeling more tangible and immediate.
