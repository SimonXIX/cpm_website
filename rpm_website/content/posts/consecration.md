A competently-produced Catholic horror film drawing on THE OMEN, THE WICKER MAN, and THE SHINING. There’s a kernel of an interesting idea at the core of the narrative but the script needed at least one more draft and perhaps would have benefitted from leaning into schlocky rather than self-serious. There’s some stunning cinematography benefitting from the natural drama of Skye’s landscape and the use of Christian, specifically Catholic, imagery deepens the film with the weight of Christianity’s inherent horror but it doesn’t feel like it adds up to very much.
