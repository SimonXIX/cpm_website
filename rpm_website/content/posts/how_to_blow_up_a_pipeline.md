When I hear motorists and politicians complain about Extinction Rebellion or Just Stop Oil blocking roads, I think they ought to be thankful that the activists are engaging in such milquetoast actions. In a just world, their SUVs would be destroyed, fossil fuel extraction and refinement facilities would be expropriated and dismantled, and private planes would be permanently grounded. As Andreas Malm argues in the book that inspires this film, property destruction and sabotage are more than justified at this stage in the climate crisis. A few well-placed drone attacks on the private planes of the most obscenely wealthy and destructive could do wonders.
