The film adaptation of Carol Clover’s *Men, Women, and Chain Saws*. Unsurprisingly this is much more subtle, clever, and effective than SCREAM (2022). SCREAM (1996) riffs on the ‘80s and ‘90s market saturation of horror films and slashers in particular in a way that feels authentic to the postmodernity of the ‘90s while also ensuring that the characters are well-drawn and have emotional cores. Wes Craven’s camera, especially in the opening scene, is far more interesting than in the requel with dynamic movements and subtle fisheye lenses. I was delighted to discover that characters opening doors while the music heightens and then there’s no killer behind the door is a franchise staple.
