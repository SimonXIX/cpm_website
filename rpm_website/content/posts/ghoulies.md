The titular ghoulies don’t do anything! Jonathan (Peter Liapis) summons the ghoulies to serve but all they do is hang out in the background chuckling menacingly. They’re so ineffective, he summons two actual servants later in the film. Even when it all kicks off, the ghoulies barely attack anyone or cause any mayhem. The untransformed mogwai in GREMLINS are more active and mischievous than the ghoulies are throughout the entire film. Stay to the end for Jack Nance the secret warlock.
