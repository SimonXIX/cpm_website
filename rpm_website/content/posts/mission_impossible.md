A fascinating time capsule of a movie that, viewed alongside the latest film in the series, speaks volumes about how this franchise has adapted to filmmaking trends over almost 30 years. Jon Voight’s character lights up a cigarette on a plane; Usenet groups are a key plot point; everything about Danny Elfman’s score: all incredibly and indelibly ‘90s. Brian De Palma crafts a much more interesting film than [DEAD RECKONING PART ONE](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/mission_impossible_dead_reckoning/) and Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt way more interestingly, really tapping into a trickster quality of the character in a way that has been reduced in his most recent po-faced portrayal of the same character thirty years later.
