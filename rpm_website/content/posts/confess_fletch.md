Just fine. A whodunnit murder mystery comedy that doesn’t stand up to recent takes on the genre like KNIVES OUT or SEE HOW THEY RUN but manages to skate along nicely on Jon Hamm’s charm and screen presence. It could definitely have been goofier with its comedy and leaned into Hamm’s comedic skills: he’s long overdue a meaty comedic role and the character of Fletch just isn’t it. The film doesn’t seem to know who it wants Fletch to be or what tone it wants to take so it comes across as toneless. Nice to see Kyle MacLachlan.
