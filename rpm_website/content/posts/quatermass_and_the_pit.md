An ancient horror buried deep beneath the clay of England waiting to unleash unimaginable evils from knowledges hidden for millennia in folk tales and superstitious legends. A palette of greys and browns that makes the splashes of colour representing objects and beings from beyond the boundary limits of human imagination all the more shocking. Political and military authorities mentally incapable of comprehending information that damages their ultimately fragile worldviews. A population of ordinary people filled with ancestral race memories of the supposedly genetically superior ritualistically slaughtering their inferiors. So, quintessentially British.
