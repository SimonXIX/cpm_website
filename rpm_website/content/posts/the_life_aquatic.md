[The Titan submersible incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Titan_submersible_incident) prompted a response by James Cameron highlighting his approach to underwater exploration. I’m struck by the contrast between Wes Anderson’s almost childlike reverence for undersea explorers in the outdated model of Jacques Costeau, expressed in THE LIFE AQUATIC and [RUSHMORE](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/rushmore/), and Cameron’s much more masculine-coded urge to conquer the depths harnessing advanced technology for his pursuit. Anderson’s view of someone who would explore the ocean is far more melancholic with Zissou cast as a tragic figure: not a hero, but someone ineluctably human and flawed, deeply so. Ultimately both Zissou and Cameron must face the same question when confronted with the immense indifference of the oceanic world beyond them, “I wonder if it remembers me?”
