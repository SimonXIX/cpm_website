Look, I’m not a stickler about spoilers and often think hysteria about spoilers is ridiculous but I feel I would have gotten more out of this if Amazon Prime Video’s description wasn’t a concise summary of the last five minutes of the film. Cronenberg is at the cusp of something with this film: a move from more straightforward filmmaking towards something more abstract yet somehow more visceral, more psychological, more—what will eventually be known as—Cronenbergian. THE BROOD’s mix of these elements isn’t quite right yet and doesn’t quite cohere. Uneven but entertaining.
