Albert Brooks’ early satire of reality television is almost too dry for its own good with a lot of the best parts carried entirely by Brooks’ delivery. This is a blessing and a curse since it pushes Brooks to carry the film himself (albeit as the worst kind of twat) rather than having confidence in his premise and its comedic potential. Nonetheless it’s very clever and very funny with incredibly sharp writing that really sticks with you. Without this, you don’t get other postmodern takes on reality TV like Peter Weir’s THE TRUMAN SHOW or Nathan Fielder’s The Rehearsal.
