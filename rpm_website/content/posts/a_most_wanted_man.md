An intelligent thriller that trusts its audience to understand that every character both believes they are doing the right thing and are also continually questioning that belief. There are no comic book villains, only a web of different and conflicting motivations that Philip Seymour Hoffman’s Günther uses to slowly but surely tighten the net around his targets. Even through a questionable German accent, Hoffman gives a quietly gripping performance as a greasier version of George Smiley, a man who is very easy to ignore even as he pulls others into orbit around him. Ultimately we’re left to question how it even makes sense to condemn someone when everyone around them is pushing them through a funnel with only one possible exit.
