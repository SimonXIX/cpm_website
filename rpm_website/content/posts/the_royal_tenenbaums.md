I went into this rewatch thinking that this might drop in [my Wes Anderson ranking](https://letterboxd.com/simonxix/list/wes-anderson-ranking/). If anything, I’m considering moving it higher. Multiple scenes in TENENBAUMS are among the most transcendently beautiful filmmaking of Anderson’s entire career: notably young Richie Tenenbaum (Arianna Turturro) releasing Mordecai; the ‘These Days’ shot; Chas (Ben Stiller) releasing his pain to his father. TENENBAUMS is a profoundly moving depiction of emotional repression and stunted family dynamics that doesn’t hold your hand in explaining the emotional complexities of its characters’ inner lives. It’s also the best cinematic adaptation of David Foster Wallace’s *Infinite Jest* that could ever exist (more so for only ever being coincidentally(?) similar).
