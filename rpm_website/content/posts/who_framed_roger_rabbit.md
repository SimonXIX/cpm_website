Still looks incredible: not just the mixing of animation and live-action elements but the period 1940s LA production design and the animation itself. It’s an ode to a period of animation before Pixarification flattened the goal of animation into verisimilitude and realistic physics. Here there’s cartoon physics, distortion of space and time, quasi-Surrealist visuals and it all looks terrifically dynamic especially in the opening Baby Herman cartoon. All the actors are smashing it, particularly Bob Hoskins and Charles Fleischer as Roger Rabbit. Simply the best film about how the corrupt judicial systems of the United States deliberately undermine and destroy reliable public transportation systems.
