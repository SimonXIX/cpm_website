If you’d asked me ten years ago which viral short film do you least expect to get a feature-length adaptation, I would have said [SALAD FINGERS (2004)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3iOROuTuMA) followed by [MARCEL THE SHELL WITH SHOES ON (2010)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF9-sEbqDvU). The eventual feature film turns out to be a marvel of technically complex stop-motion animation which also captures something poignant about loss, trauma, dementia, and ageing. There’s a surprising amount of the writers in the film: the line about discovering that an audience is not the same thing as a community feels profoundly true.
