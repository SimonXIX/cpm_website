“It’s always difficult coming back to England[...]”.

Patrick Keiller’s peripatetic essay films remind me of the best of David Foster Wallace’s creative non-fiction (his visits to the State Fair, the pornography convention, and the cruise) in their style and digressive nature. They both share a sense of minutely detailed reportage gradually accreting into unerringly precise interpretative analysis. This one is a little more diffuse in focus than [LONDON](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/london/), psychocartographically charting England’s post-modern decline through the prism of industrialisation.
