An American family discovers their ancestral Scottish titles and, to the delight of locals who love licking the boot of the British Empire, must decide whether to take on the vast tracts of land that their ancestors stole in the Clearances despite knowing nothing about the ecological responsibilities of Highland land ownership. The strangest element is the intense and flirtatious relationship between the brother and sister who continually talk about how “close” they used to be and have more chemistry than any other couple.
