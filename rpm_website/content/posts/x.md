Like BARBARIAN, it’s disappointing how X uses elderly women’s bodies as a locus of horror especially when Natalie Erika James’ [RELIC](https://takeonecinema.net/2020/relic/) so effectively subverted this trope to much less popular acclaim. To its credit, X does complicate its depiction of elderly sexuality with some degree of sympathy for its antagonists and its depiction of sexuality as fundamentally human. It builds tension effectively enough and its self-awareness is somewhat fun but the film is ultimately too in thrall to its 1970s slasher references especially THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and simply isn’t enough of a subversion of the rural horror subgenre to be any more than a retread.
