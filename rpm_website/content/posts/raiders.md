Like [ALIEN ON STAGE](https://takeonecinema.net/2021/alien-on-stage/) and [A BUNCH OF AMATEURS](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/a_bunch_of_amateurs/), RAIDERS! is a charming insight into amateur filmmaking that reveals the importance of creative outlets for ordinary people outside the big-budget industrial systems of mainstream filmmaking. In terms of melancholy, this skews more towards A BUNCH OF AMATEURS as the documentary reveals the petty dramas of the filmmakers’ childhood that pushed them apart and the quasi-dangerous obsession that completing their film has become. There’s an ‘80s Stephen Kingish poignancy throughout in the implication that their lives’ biggest achievement is something they did as kids.
