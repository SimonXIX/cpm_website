These days, a huge amount of money would be spent on special effects to make the boat chase actually look like it’s taking place in Venice. Steven Spielberg correctly intuits that it’s enough for an audience to watch boats going fast and makes no attempt to disguise the dockyard (presumably in California) where it’s actually filmed. Such is the strength of Sean Connery’s performance as Henry Jones Sr. that as a kid I thought every third film in a series should introduce the main character’s parents. Perhaps one too many action scenes for me these days but the three trials before the Grail are really tense and masterfully edited. Spielberg is such a safe pair of hands as a blockbuster director that it’s a real comfort watch.
