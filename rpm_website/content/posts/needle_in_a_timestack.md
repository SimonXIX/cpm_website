You wonder why they kept this title until you hear the screenplay’s idea of dialogue. For a film about time travel shenanigans, it’s ploddingly leaden and self-serious all the way through with dialogue either being outright expository or sour-faced portentousness (apart from the protagonist’s sister who actually speaks quite naturally usually about her quote best friend unquote). Considering how central it is to the plot, the depiction of time travel and memory retention didn’t seem coherent: if they could remember things temporarily after a timeshift, why not just write down what they remember right then before they forgot? What was with the time-proof servers for storing jpegs? What is a timestack?
