PAPRIKA has the visual and narrative inventiveness that fans of INCEPTION think it has. It’s a joyously confusing depiction of dreams and dreamscapes that I’ll need to watch a second time to properly take in. Kon Satoshi uses just enough analogy between dreams and both cinema and the internet to be intriguing but not to weigh the narrative down with allegory. The continual fat jokes raised an eyebrow but, like [TOKYO GODFATHERS](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/tokyo_godfathers/)’ queerness, it feels like they were in service of humanising a character who others might treat as ridiculous.
