Lousy Carter (David Krumholtz) is dying and Bob Byington’s film invites us to ask, who cares? On paper, he’s an unlikeable American literature professor, a narcissist with few friends who halfheartedly pursues a relationship with a student. But David Krumholtz brings him to life with a genuine humanism and dry charm. It’s a comedy that is wonderfully ambivalent about its own existence with the ultimate joke being that, despite openly hating itself, an audience can watch it and enjoy it.
