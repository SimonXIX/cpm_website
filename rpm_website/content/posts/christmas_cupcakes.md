X xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx 'xxxxx xxxxxxxx xx xxxxxxx' Xxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxx x xxxxxx lack of background music in scenes where you’d expect it. But then! The second half injects genuine energy through Kristian Bruun’s (queer-coded?) villainous artisan baker and, most significantly, through Greg Lawson is channelling Ricardo Montalbán at his most scenery-chewing in his role as Chef Paolo Joeljinjo, an enigmatic but strangely compelling judge of a local TV baking competition show. Lawson’s performance alone saves the film and I’m honestly glad we didn’t turn the film off.
