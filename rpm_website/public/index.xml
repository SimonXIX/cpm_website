      <description>You wonder why they kept this title until you hear the screenplay’s idea of dialogue. For a film about time travel shenanigans, it’s ploddingly leaden and self-serious all the way through with dialogue either being outright expository or sour-faced portentousness (apart from the protagonist’s sister who actually speaks quite naturally usually about her quote best friend unquote).</description>

      <description>When I was at school, a teacher wrote the word ‘prat’ on a pupil’s forehead in permanent marker. I wasn’t in the class where this happened but it became legend throughout the school, passed on through gossip in the corridors and the schoolyard.</description>

      <description>Still looks incredible: not just the mixing of animation and live-action elements but the period 1940s LA production design and the animation itself.</description>

      <description>No horror film builds dread in quite the same way as idly noticing from a date in a brief shot that this film starts in 2019.</description>

      <description>An exploration not just of the Sackler family and their role in the opioid crisis and the art world but of how alternative communities live, thrive, and survive.</description>

      <description>“And there’s this feeling, once you leave where you grew up, that you don’t totally belong there again.” When I was a kid in the ‘90s, we&amp;rsquo;d go on family holidays to resorts in places like Majorca and Malta.</description>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/primal_fear/</guid>
      <description>PRIMAL FEAR contains some of the understated hallmarks of ‘90s thrillers: an obsession with property development; corruption that goes up to the highest levels of local government; questionable treatment of mental health issues; women that exist only in the orbit of men.</description>

      <description>A West German B-movie horror, the best part of which is the interesting production design from the paintings influenced by Hieronymous Bosch to the locations evocative of Dark Souls.</description>

      <description>Quiet devastation erupts in discrete moments of an otherwise drawn-out trial. Alice Diop shows the processes of institutional justice in all their long, slow, and wordy reality with long shots on one person talking, defending herself, and repeating her life story for the court.</description>

      <description>These days, a huge amount of money would be spent on special effects to make the boat chase actually look like it’s taking place in Venice.</description>

      <title>Tár (2022) - 158 mins</title>

      <description>Cate Blanchett plays Lydia Tár as a charming, authoritative, magnetic, and terrible person. We’re fully immersed in the life and perspective of a deeply unpleasant person and there’s a complex catharsis as the film charts her downfall.</description>

      <description>A 1970s BBC British horror that has fallen through time to be released in 2023. The Volunteer (Mary Woodvine) undertakes the same ritual each and every day and it gradually becomes clear that she’s not a botanist but something deeper—something older—and that the flower she’s protecting is something more.</description>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/eo/</guid>
      <description>EO directed by Jerzy Skolimowski uses the language of cinema to push us to empathise with a non-human protagonist and therefore expand our sense of subjectivity to cover the perspective of its titular donkey.</description>

      <description>A post-apocalyptic period piece filmed in the context of the nuclear annihilation of two cities and 220,000 people, RASHOMON strips down humanity until it finds cynicism, deceit, selfishness, and despair.</description>

      <description>If you set out to purposefully miscast a film, you couldn’t do a better job than THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES did inadvertently.</description>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/klute/</guid>
      <description>A great performance from Jane Fonda as a sex worker whose reward for navigating a paranoid world of shadowy figures and sexual assault is to end up with John Klute (Donald Sutherland), the most boring man alive.</description>

      <description>Not my favourite of Lawrence Gordon Clark’s Ghost Stories for Christmas, LOST HEARTS is altogether too literal. Adaptations of James work best when the haunting is diffuse, unknowable, and tied to the ghost of England.</description>

      <description>Like THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS feels like a play in that it’s carried by its terrific dialogue and performances.</description>
