      <description>Beautifully shot, joyously inventive and subversive, emotionally real. Most importantly, RYE LANE captures the messy energy of South London, a place I called home for the better part of a decade.</description>

      <description>A film where the central thesis—that visual language in cinema, primarily shot composition, both perpetuates and is produced by patriarchal ways of seeing women that contribute to the mainstream cinema industry’s excess of economic discrimination against women and sexual assault against women—is obviously and inarguably true but the presentation of that thesis severely hampers the power of the film.</description>

      <description>Following on from GUARDIANS’s focus on the human, the overarching theme of the Guardians films is represented in the moment when Ego (Kurt Russell) tells Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) that while he’s alive Peter is a god and if Peter kills him he’ll be just like everybody else.</description>

      <description>One shot that hit me this viewing was the quick shot towards the end of Dey (John C. Reilly) returning home after the obligatory Marvel third act battle to his family, his partner and his daughter.</description>

      <description>My reaction to this film was heavily influenced by the fact I last saw the Guardians characters in the Avengers films where they were done dirty.</description>

      <description>Quite apart from the blossoming of his distinctive aesthetic (developed in collaboration with his long-time cinematographer Robert Yeoman who rarely gets enough credit for it), RUSHMORE provides early insights into many of the deeper themes and preoccupations that would go on to define Wes Anderson’s work: a focus on class and social status particularly with regards to the hierarchy of positions within esoteric institutions; an eye for the outsider figure and the social outcast; a fascination with under the sea and the life aquatic.</description>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/basic_instinct/</guid>
      <description>An interesting deconstruction of the masculinity inherent to film noir with a cop antagonist who is a bully, a prick, and a rapist presented alongside a be-gay-do-crimes queer femme fatale who is a confident badass and successful novelist.</description>

      <description>And then it’s twenty years later and you’re addicted to your nostalgia. You see ghosts of your own memories from the corner of your eyes on the streets you used to know and the songs you once knew so well are dim echoes that you can’t quite make out.</description>

      <description>A cosmic mix of the dramas of the ‘10s combined with the exploitation films of the ‘70s. There is constant surprise in how layered and postmodern the film is willing to get but it always keeps a sense of playfulness and joy in its use of ‘70s exploitation tropes and metafictional devices right up until the end.</description>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/wet_hot_american_summer/</guid>
      <description>WET HOT AMERICAN SUMMER works best when it’s leaning into its silliness which unfortunately it doesn’t do frequently enough: the going-to-town montage is great; the subplot with Ken Marino’s character trying to get back to camp is gold.</description>

      <description>This film deserves the acclaim that ANCHORMAN has for some reason: undeniably up there with THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE! as a perfectly observed absurdist parody of its genre.</description>

      <description>Loath though I am to suggest that this film should have more THE ROOM-level dialogue or more scenes of hunky shirtless men or more confusingly-staged melodrama or more scenes of the mother (Nicky Whelan) and son (Parker Mack) who look the same age but PRETTY LITTLE STALKERS really needed more establishing scenes for most of its central characters.</description>

      <description>This needed to be a few degrees closer to LIMITLESS on the magic-drug-subgenre spectrum. The core premise is interesting and I liked the film’s allusions to the racial implications of time travel but a film about time travel drugs really doesn’t need to be so dour and so bogged down in character work that really doesn’t add anything narratively or thematically.</description>

      <description>A competently-produced Catholic horror film drawing on THE OMEN, THE WICKER MAN, and THE SHINING. There’s a kernel of an interesting idea at the core of the narrative but the script needed at least one more draft and perhaps would have benefitted from leaning into schlocky rather than self-serious.</description>

      <description>The superhero movie that Marvel won’t provide: well-lit, practical effects, strongly defined character relationships and romantic entanglements. Seemingly a commentary on a film market saturated with superhero movies: it feels like Quentin Dupieux had to make a superhero movie because nothing else gets made these days and it was the only way he could tell his absurdist stories about fish concerned with water pollution, a helmet that traps you in your thoughts, and a liquified human’s remains in a bucket.</description>

      <description>A 1970s BBC British horror that has fallen through time to be released in 2023.

      <description>EO directed by Jerzy Skolimowski uses the language of cinema to push us to empathise with a non-human protagonist and therefore expand our sense of subjectivity to cover the perspective of its titular donkey.</description>

      <description>A post-apocalyptic period piece filmed in the context of the nuclear annihilation of two cities and 220,000 people, RASHOMON strips down humanity until it finds cynicism, deceit, selfishness, and despair.</description>

      <description>A great performance from Jane Fonda as a sex worker whose reward for navigating a paranoid world of shadowy figures and sexual assault is to end up with John Klute (Donald Sutherland), the most boring man alive.</description>

      <description>Not my favourite of Lawrence Gordon Clark’s Ghost Stories for Christmas, LOST HEARTS is altogether too literal. Adaptations of James work best when the haunting is diffuse, unknowable, and tied to the ghost of England.</description>

      <description>Like THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS feels like a play in that it’s carried by its terrific dialogue and performances.</description>
