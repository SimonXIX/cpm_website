      <title>Eileen (2023) - 98 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Hitchcock-inspired thriller complete with a Hitchcock Blonde named Rebecca. There’s an unusual tone but, like Anne Hathaway’s Rebecca, there’s a strange seductiveness to the whole thing even while you begin to wonder if the shoe is ever going to drop. It’s one of those films where there’s a very specific vibe and the success of the film depends on keying into that vibe. In that way, it reminded me of Paul Feig’s A SIMPLE FAVO(U)R and while that film leapt over the edge of sheer ridiculousness, EILEEN dances on the precipice but doesn’t quite fall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Saltburn (2023) - 131 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emerald Fennell follows up her debut with another black comedy dealing with a vector of privilege: this time, the British class system. However the satirising of the upper class never feels as precisely incisive as PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN’s examination of abusive men and “nice guys”. There’s a funny visual gag involving Harry Potter but the portrayal of the upper class family too often pivots into caricature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>El Conde (2023) - 111 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EL CONDE’s opening narration carries the underlying implication that the major figures of late 20th Century neoliberalism were literal vampires. By the end, any subtlety to this satire is gone and the heavy-handedness of the allegory becomes rather draining. The film’s interesting if unsubtle allegory positioning neoliberal politicians influenced by the Chicago Boys as bloodsucking vampires is undermined by the third act’s frankly silly revelations. There are some undeniably beautiful images—a young Pinoche (Clemente Rodríguez) licking blood off a guillotine’s blade in Revolutionary France; the older Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) gliding above the streets of Santiago, cape flapping in the breeze—but they’re in service of a film that never really comes together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been to that carousel in Brooklyn: walked around the riverfront and had my photo taken in front of the Manhattan backdrop by the person I love. But PAST LIVES felt like a memory long before that scene. It’s so deeply and delicately enmeshed in a sense of time(s) and place(s) that it feels specific, it feels real, it feels like a memory in a way that &lt;a href=&#34;https://allunits.libsyn.com/calling-all-units-abuse-of-power-comes-as-no-surprise-tarantinocore-green-room&#34;&gt;tears a feeling open inside you&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the script’s jabs at the voyeuristic nature of cinema and Arthur’s (John Magaro) self-reflexive monologue about the clichéd story structure, PAST LIVES feels wholly original, wholly new, and wholly real.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fremont (2023) - 92 mins</title>
      <link>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/fremont/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A very charming little film about loneliness, ennui, and displacement. The film is driven by Anaita Wali Zada’s subtly expressive central performance but there’s something to love in both of the other two central players, Gregg Turkington and Jeremy Allen White, each expressing a different facet of American loneliness. There’s more than a little bit of Ben Sharrock’s LIMBO in how the film is shot and how the camera’s rigidity, its fixedness, and the boxy, claustrophobic frame speaks to the film’s themes. A quietly devastating critique of America’s imperialism and platitudinous culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The faces of white people are always obscured in BROTHER, either positioned just out of frame or out of focus in the background of a shot. The film tells us that we don’t need to see the face of the oppressor: they are faceless, formless. Instead we see the effects of Black trauma reverberating through non-linear time, ripples spreading backwards and forwards through the timeline of a life from one devastating moment. Aaron Pierre is an incredible on-screen presence as Francis, the one person in Michael’s (Lamar Johnson) life that makes him feel safe and the entire film is structured around that relationship and that sense of safety. How do you continue when that safety is suddenly taken away?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Venice is a ghost town in this movie. Presumably due to Covid restrictions during filming, the city is heartbreakingly empty. Piazza San Marco and Campo della Salute bustle with tourists, even at night, and yet here they have only one or two people milling about as a backdrop for the main characters. It’s emblematic of the film which sees a dozen beautiful people fight amongst themselves in beautiful locations that feel devoid of civilians or actual threat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An impossible gem of a film. It seems impossible that you can push the form of a documentary so far towards social realist aesthetics and structure. It seems impossible that there are people like Shabu who so embody the heart and spirit of their community with all its optimism, all its joy, all its sorrow, and all its rhythmic Blackness. Like &lt;a href=&#34;https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/cinetopia/episodes/September-2021-on-EH-FM-Annette--Rose-Plays-Julie--Gagarine-and-The-Last-Forest-e17kik3&#34;&gt;GAGARINE&lt;/a&gt;, SHABU exposes the beauty of social housing projects that seem impossible under neoliberalism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Asteroid City (2023) - 105 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ASTEROID CITY serves as something of an artistic statement for this period of Wes Anderson’s filmmaking, overtly discussing existential themes around meaning and, in particular, finding meaning through art that emphasise Anderson’s complicating of modernism and postmodernism. When Adrien Brody’s director character says that the meaning doesn’t matter, he’s talking through the fourth wall to viewers alienated by Anderson’s idiosyncratic aesthetics. ASTEROID CITY tells the viewer not only how to read it but how to read all of Anderson’s work by openly stating that how the viewer approaches his films is critical to how the works produce sincerity with and through their ironic postmodern conceits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The March on Rome (Marcia su Roma) (2022) - 97 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mark Cousins’ calm matter-of-fact narration doesn’t impose parallels between Italian fascist propaganda of the 1920s and today’s modern fascist propaganda but instead allows the obvious parallels to speak for themselves. Like Claude Lanzmann, Cousins damns fascists—Trump, Bolsonaro, Le Pen, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2021/oct/23/judith-butler-gender-ideology-backlash&#34;&gt;the UK’s transphobic movement&lt;/a&gt;—by showing the words they have actually said. There’s more than a little liberal equivocation and naïvety in asking what should be done with relics of fascist heritage but the methodical close reading of films like A NOI! (1922, dir. Umberto Paradisi) drew me in as a great example of reading politics from cinema.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sanctuary (2022) - 96 mins</title>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/sanctuary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SANCTUARY’s thoughtful depiction of fetish uses the sense of mystery behind sub-dom to bring the audience into the characters’ tangled power dynamics. You’re made part of the role-play because you, like the characters, don’t know what is real and what is erotic play. This wouldn’t work if the film didn’t also make you want Margaret Qualley to step on you. Her expressive face conveys what is otherwise left unsaid while also hiding secrets behind the role-play. The power of her role is in making you fall in love with her while basically learning nothing about her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/typist_artist_pirate_king/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An England seen through the prism of mental illness might be the truest view of England. TYPIST ARTIST PIRATE KING takes the audience on a psychogeographic journey along the length of England through the eyes of Audrey Amiss (Monica Dolan), a mentally ill British artist whose work was only recognised after her death in 2013. Audrey describes herself as “avant-garde and misunderstood”, a perpetual victim let down by society and those around her. Like TÁR, the world of the film is a reflection of the protagonist’s mental state and we see an England without stability, an England replete with abandoned hospitals and Viking battles and Morris dancers in the street and low-simmering resentments against perceived enemies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Other People’s Children (Les Enfants des autres) (2022) - 104 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD is to thirty-somethings what OTHER PEOPLE’S CHILDREN is to forty-somethings: a mature emotionally resonant romantic comedy-drama that embraces the complexity of modern relationships. Since I’m closer to forty than thirty, I was more affected by this film about a childless adult navigating relationships with other people’s children while conflicted about their own potential for parenthood than the former. It’s honestly refreshing to see a romantic comedy that straightforwardly deals with adulthood, sexuality, and parenthood with far more emotional maturity than any Hollywood romcom. Get the ‘unnecessary sex scene’ discourse people to watch this and have their heads explode.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiet devastation erupts in discrete moments of an otherwise drawn-out trial. Alice Diop shows the processes of institutional justice in all their long, slow, and wordy reality with long shots on one person talking, defending herself, and repeating her life story for the court. But like being on an actual jury, being in court is more boring than you might imagine. It feels like the documentary form might have been better for this kind of exploration of structural racism, France’s treatment of African immigrants, and challenging preconceptions. That said, there are moments of emotion that burst through the trudge of a jury trial: when two Black women share a glance and a smile in the midst of everything. Maybe that’s the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cate Blanchett plays Lydia Tár as a charming, authoritative, magnetic, and terrible person. We’re fully immersed in the life and perspective of a deeply unpleasant person and there’s a complex catharsis as the film charts her downfall. Todd Field makes us feel not sympathy but maybe empathy for Tár even as we’re disgusted by her many abusive actions. Cinema at its best encourages us to explore complex and complicated feelings and TÁR is at once delicate, considered, and forceful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/enys_men/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A 1970s BBC British horror that has fallen through time to be released in 2023. The Volunteer (Mary Woodvine) undertakes the same ritual each and every day and it gradually becomes clear that she’s not a botanist but something deeper—something older—and that the flower she’s protecting is something more. ENYS MEN shows an England where nothing changes to such an extent that time starts flowing backwards and overlapping with itself. Memories, people, places, and objects all merge into one as the relentlessness of conservatism flattens everything into the same person, the same flower, the same menhir.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/eo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;EO directed by Jerzy Skolimowski uses the language of cinema to push us to empathise with a non-human protagonist and therefore expand our sense of subjectivity to cover the perspective of its titular donkey. Without dialogue and with an incredible soundscape, EO follows a circus donkey as he encounters other animals and wanders through the ruins and conflicts of modern European history. Like Kossakovsky’s GUNDA and Arnold’s COW, EO pushes us to consider the exploitation of animals and the subjectivity of the others on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
