      <description>The Deserter in Disco Elysium talks about “[t]he mask of humanity fall[ing] from capital. It has to take it off to kill everyone—everything you love; all the hope and tenderness in the world.</description>

      <description>I’ve been to that carousel in Brooklyn: walked around the riverfront and had my photo taken in front of the Manhattan backdrop by the person I love.</description>

      <description>Continuing a series of films about deeply frustrating German men. Leon (Thomas Schubert) is always watching people from a distance and talking to them through windows accentuating the gulf he perceives between himself and other people.</description>

      <description>How does an intelligent, socially conscious woman approach writing a Barbie movie in the year 2023? Greta Gerwig approaches it in a way not unlike Charlie Kaufman adapting Susan Orlean’s The Orchid Thief: by deconstructing what it means to write a Barbie movie in our current sociopolitical moment and acknowledging the multivalent, complicated, and contradictory nature of Barbie’s image throughout the 20th Century and into the present.</description>

      <description>ASTEROID CITY serves as something of an artistic statement for this period of Wes Anderson’s filmmaking, overtly discussing existential themes around meaning and, in particular, finding meaning through art that emphasise Anderson’s complicating of modernism and postmodernism.</description>

      <description>Beautifully shot, joyously inventive and subversive, emotionally real. Most importantly, RYE LANE captures the messy energy of South London, a place I called home for the better part of a decade.</description>

      <description>Mark Cousins’ calm matter-of-fact narration doesn’t impose parallels between Italian fascist propaganda of the 1920s and today’s modern fascist propaganda but instead allows the obvious parallels to speak for themselves.</description>

      <description>When I hear motorists and politicians complain about Extinction Rebellion or Just Stop Oil blocking roads, I think they ought to be thankful that the activists are engaging in such milquetoast actions.</description>

      <description>This year’s EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE: a joyous and hilarious blend of genres that uses irony and maximalist extravagance to speak sincerely about specific lived experience but in a universal way.</description>

      <title>Women Talking (2022) - 104 mins</title>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/women_talking/</guid>
      <description>An adaptation less confident in its source material might have focused on what comes before and what happens after but WOMEN TALKING focuses in on the crux, the critical moments of decision that determine the fate of these women, their community, their families, and their religion.</description>

      <title>Tár (2022) - 158 mins</title>

      <description>Cate Blanchett plays Lydia Tár as a charming, authoritative, magnetic, and terrible person. We’re fully immersed in the life and perspective of a deeply unpleasant person and there’s a complex catharsis as the film charts her downfall.</description>
