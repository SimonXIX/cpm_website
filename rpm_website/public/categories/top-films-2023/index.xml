      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you were to forensically analyse a single half-hour in the shared life of a couple, would it be possible to extrapolate out from that point to deduce the full shape of their life together? Could you chart their emotional topography from a single fight or a passive-aggressive gesture? As the film progresses, we see there’s no more emotional truth to this kind of analysis than there is in reading a novel as autobiography.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Killers of the Flower Moon (2023) - 206 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Deserter in &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt; talks about “[t]he mask of humanity fall[ing] from capital. It has to take it off to kill everyone—everything you love; all the hope and tenderness in the world. It has to take it off, just for one second. To do the deed.” The horror in KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is how little the mask slips even as Osage people are murdered and brutalised. Black Wall Street and the KKK are backgrounded and instead the film is driven by the percussive bass beat of a more insidious form of racism: Hale (Robert De Niro) and Ernest (Leonardo DiCaprio) don’t hate the Osage—they learn their culture and their language—but they never view the Osage as people. Through their eyes, Osage are not capitalist subjects worthy of wealth but objects standing in the way of the money they view as their birthright as white men. Then in the film’s closing scenes, Scorsese turns the camera around to expose his own complicity and the film’s (predominately white) audience’s complicity in the ‘true crime’ exploitation of the Osage Nation even as he, too late, centres the experience of Mollie Burkhart (Lily Gladstone) before passing the frame to the Osage as a final gesture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Past Lives (2023) - 106 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been to that carousel in Brooklyn: walked around the riverfront and had my photo taken in front of the Manhattan backdrop by the person I love. But PAST LIVES felt like a memory long before that scene. It’s so deeply and delicately enmeshed in a sense of time(s) and place(s) that it feels specific, it feels real, it feels like a memory in a way that &lt;a href=&#34;https://allunits.libsyn.com/calling-all-units-abuse-of-power-comes-as-no-surprise-tarantinocore-green-room&#34;&gt;tears a feeling open inside you&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the script’s jabs at the voyeuristic nature of cinema and Arthur’s (John Magaro) self-reflexive monologue about the clichéd story structure, PAST LIVES feels wholly original, wholly new, and wholly real.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Afire (Roter Himmel) (2023) - 103 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing a series of &lt;a href=&#34;https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/passages/&#34;&gt;films about deeply frustrating German men&lt;/a&gt;. Leon (Thomas Schubert) is always watching people from a distance and talking to them through windows accentuating the gulf he perceives between himself and other people. He’s one of life’s naysayers—saying no to others, to himself, to joy, to creative expression—and can be a real asshole but he’s relatable nonetheless. Christian Petzold directs with his characteristic light touch deftly commenting on narcissism, publishing, and climate crisis in ways that feel effortlessly natural. Even though the whole is a little uneven in tone, the film comes together beautifully and tragically in its final moments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Barbie (2023) - 114 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does an intelligent, socially conscious woman approach writing a Barbie movie in the year 2023? Greta Gerwig approaches it in a way not unlike Charlie Kaufman adapting Susan Orlean’s &lt;em&gt;The Orchid Thief&lt;/em&gt;: by deconstructing what it means to write a Barbie movie in our current sociopolitical moment and acknowledging the multivalent, complicated, and contradictory nature of Barbie’s image throughout the 20th Century and into the present. It’s a post-ironic, postmodern exploration of feminism and patriarchal capitalism wrapped in the pink and glitters of camp maximalist extravagance that, in a comparison I never expected, works like TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME in transforming a blonde white woman from an object to a subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Asteroid City (2023) - 105 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ASTEROID CITY serves as something of an artistic statement for this period of Wes Anderson’s filmmaking, overtly discussing existential themes around meaning and, in particular, finding meaning through art that emphasise Anderson’s complicating of modernism and postmodernism. When Adrien Brody’s director character says that the meaning doesn’t matter, he’s talking through the fourth wall to viewers alienated by Anderson’s idiosyncratic aesthetics. ASTEROID CITY tells the viewer not only how to read it but how to read all of Anderson’s work by openly stating that how the viewer approaches his films is critical to how the works produce sincerity with and through their ironic postmodern conceits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rye Lane (2023) - 82 mins</title>
      <link>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/rye_lane/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beautifully shot, joyously inventive and subversive, emotionally real. Most importantly, RYE LANE captures the messy energy of South London, a place I called home for the better part of a decade. It’s not just the places in Peckham and Brixton that I walked past a hundred times, it’s the people that the film depicts who all have that ineffable South London quality that makes the place a real community within a metropolis. Capturing that spirit on film is nothing short of incredible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The March on Rome (Marcia su Roma) (2022) - 97 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mark Cousins’ calm matter-of-fact narration doesn’t impose parallels between Italian fascist propaganda of the 1920s and today’s modern fascist propaganda but instead allows the obvious parallels to speak for themselves. Like Claude Lanzmann, Cousins damns fascists—Trump, Bolsonaro, Le Pen, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2021/oct/23/judith-butler-gender-ideology-backlash&#34;&gt;the UK’s transphobic movement&lt;/a&gt;—by showing the words they have actually said. There’s more than a little liberal equivocation and naïvety in asking what should be done with relics of fascist heritage but the methodical close reading of films like A NOI! (1922, dir. Umberto Paradisi) drew me in as a great example of reading politics from cinema.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Blow Up a Pipeline (2022) - 104 mins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I hear motorists and politicians complain about Extinction Rebellion or Just Stop Oil blocking roads, I think they ought to be thankful that the activists are engaging in such milquetoast actions. In a just world, their SUVs would be destroyed, fossil fuel extraction and refinement facilities would be expropriated and dismantled, and private planes would be permanently grounded. As Andreas Malm argues in the book that inspires this film, property destruction and sabotage are more than justified at this stage in the climate crisis. A few well-placed drone attacks on the private planes of the most obscenely wealthy and destructive could do wonders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Polite Society (2023) - 103 mins</title>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/polite_society/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year’s EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE: a joyous and hilarious blend of genres that uses irony and maximalist extravagance to speak sincerely about specific lived experience but in a universal way. POLITE SOCIETY is a modern Jane Austen story that combines wuxia films like CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON with comic-book style films like SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD all in service of a story that speaks to how modern British-Pakistani women approach practices like arranged marriage and how the generational trauma of second-generation immigrants continues to filter down to their children. Outstanding supporting turns from Ella Bruccoleri, Seraphina Beh, and Nimra Bucha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Women Talking (2022) - 104 mins</title>
      <link>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/women_talking/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An adaptation less confident in its source material might have focused on what comes before and what happens after but WOMEN TALKING focuses in on the crux, the critical moments of decision that determine the fate of these women, their community, their families, and their religion. In so doing, the colony becomes a synecdoche for patriarchal society and their decision reflects the myriad of difficult decisions women need to make to survive and keep themselves safe. Excellent performances from Claire Foy and Jessie Buckley bring the film’s stagier aspects to life and an astonishing score by Hildur Guðnadóttir fills the silence between the talking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tár (2022) - 158 mins</title>
      <link>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/tar/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cate Blanchett plays Lydia Tár as a charming, authoritative, magnetic, and terrible person. We’re fully immersed in the life and perspective of a deeply unpleasant person and there’s a complex catharsis as the film charts her downfall. Todd Field makes us feel not sympathy but maybe empathy for Tár even as we’re disgusted by her many abusive actions. Cinema at its best encourages us to explore complex and complicated feelings and TÁR is at once delicate, considered, and forceful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
