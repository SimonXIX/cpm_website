      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Hitchcock-inspired thriller complete with a Hitchcock Blonde named Rebecca. There’s an unusual tone but, like Anne Hathaway’s Rebecca, there’s a strange seductiveness to the whole thing even while you begin to wonder if the shoe is ever going to drop. It’s one of those films where there’s a very specific vibe and the success of the film depends on keying into that vibe. In that way, it reminded me of Paul Feig’s A SIMPLE FAVO(U)R and while that film leapt over the edge of sheer ridiculousness, EILEEN dances on the precipice but doesn’t quite fall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emerald Fennell follows up her debut with another black comedy dealing with a vector of privilege: this time, the British class system. However the satirising of the upper class never feels as precisely incisive as PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN’s examination of abusive men and “nice guys”. There’s a funny visual gag involving Harry Potter but the portrayal of the upper class family too often pivots into caricature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
