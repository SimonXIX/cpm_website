      <description>Deliciously tense and delightfully staged, the uncharacteristically wobbly camerawork and rapid-pace dialogue all build tension so well.</description>

      <description>On paper, the most disturbing of these Anderson adaptaions of Dahl but this one didn’t quite click.</description>

      <description>A wonderful microcosm of Anderson unearthing sincerity from layers of artifice while drawing attention to the artifice.</description>

      <description>A compelling experiment in marrying Anderson and Yeoman’s aesthetic to a straight adaptation although Dahl’s original text contains several Anderson hallmarks: nested structure; quick-wittedness.</description>

      <description>Enigmatically enticing as a little crystallisation of mid-Anderson aesthetic. Would work better standalone.</description>

      <description>It’s easy to read THE DARJEELING LIMITED as self-indulgent: three wealthy white American men searching for a spiritual experience in a culture with which they make no effort to engage.</description>

      <description>I went into this rewatch thinking that this might drop in my Wes Anderson ranking. If anything, I’m considering moving it higher.</description>

      <description>Until the film’s final scene, I would have said that this is, surprisingly, Wes Anderson’s most anti-capitalist film: the contrast between the coldly metallic heavy industrialisation of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean’s farms and the warm autumnal palette of the animals’ home; Mr.</description>

      <description>I remembered this as the slightest of Wes Anderson’s live-action scripts with Roman Coppola, most notable for the extreme precision of the film’s Andersonian clockwork diorama world and evocativeness of music and visuals.</description>

      <description>Like the main characters, this film has a charm and a sincerity that are both beguiling even while it settles into a diffuseness that feels a little frustrating.</description>

      <description>This short’s conciseness and energy work better to convey the themes than the feature.</description>

      <title>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004) - 119 mins</title>

      <description>The Titan submersible incident prompted a response by James Cameron highlighting his approach to underwater exploration. I’m struck by the contrast between Wes Anderson’s almost childlike reverence for undersea explorers in the outdated model of Jacques Costeau, expressed in THE LIFE AQUATIC and RUSHMORE, and Cameron’s much more masculine-coded urge to conquer the depths harnessing advanced technology for his pursuit.</description>

      <title>Asteroid City (2023) - 105 mins</title>

      <guid>https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/posts/asteroid_city/</guid>
      <description>ASTEROID CITY serves as something of an artistic statement for this period of Wes Anderson’s filmmaking, overtly discussing existential themes around meaning and, in particular, finding meaning through art that emphasise Anderson’s complicating of modernism and postmodernism.</description>

      <description>Quite apart from the blossoming of his distinctive aesthetic (developed in collaboration with his long-time cinematographer Robert Yeoman who rarely gets enough credit for it), RUSHMORE provides early insights into many of the deeper themes and preoccupations that would go on to define Wes Anderson’s work: a focus on class and social status particularly with regards to the hierarchy of positions within esoteric institutions; an eye for the outsider figure and the social outcast; a fascination with under the sea and the life aquatic.</description>
